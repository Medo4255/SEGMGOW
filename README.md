Introducing a prototype charity website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports three user roles: administrators, donors, and organization representatives. Administrators manage requests and users, donors can make donations and track delivery times, and organization representatives can request donations and view their donation history.

Launch the webpage from the Home.html file found in the html folder.

Keep in mind that some pages may have incomplete featurs.
